# Anti-slop pass

A checklist for stripping filler from technical documentation. Use it two ways:

- **While writing:** keep these patterns out.
- **As a deslop pass:** run over an existing doc and delete or rewrite every match.

The test for every sentence: **does it state a fact, a number, a path, a
command, a decision, or an action?** If not, cut it. Tone, reassurance, and
editorializing are not information.

`jouzu-clear-writing` covers structure, terminology, the reader's task, and fact
preservation. This checklist covers the recurring filler patterns that survive
that work.

## The core rule

Marketing-speak and pseudo-insight do not belong in technical docs, in any
section, ever. Every banned pattern below is an instance of this rule. Sort each
candidate sentence into one of two buckets:

- **Carries information that matters:** mark it structurally — a bolded
  sentence, a `NOTE:` / `WARNING:` callout, or a labeled table row. Importance
  is signaled by placement, not by cadence, adjectives, or emphasis-prose.
- **Filler or fluff:** delete it. Don't soften it or keep it "for tone."

If you can't tell which bucket a sentence is in, treat it as filler. The numbered
patterns below are the recurring ways slop sneaks back into the first bucket.

## Preserve useful conventions

Keep changelog categories, issue and pull-request templates, formal register
where the audience expects it, and lists or tables that help readers find facts.
Conventional structure is not filler. A list of three distinct items needs no
change merely because it has three items. Remove padding inside the structure;
do not dismantle the structure to make the text look less formulaic.

## Banned patterns

### 1. Editorializing adjectives on facts

Words that grade a fact instead of stating it: `load-bearing`, `crucial`,
`critical` (as prose, not a priority label), `key`, `important to note`,
`notably`, `it's worth noting`, `interestingly`, `powerful`, `robust`,
`seamless`, `elegant`, `clean`, `proper`, `genuine`, `real` (as in "a real
gap").

- ❌ "This is the load-bearing design decision."
- ✅ "The worker retries the job twice, then reports it as failed."
- ❌ "Notably, the manifest records per-file checksums."
- ✅ "The manifest records per-file checksums."

A priority column in a table (`Value: Critical`) is fine — that's a label, not
prose.

### 2. The "it's not X, it's Y" / "not debt, but a feature" frame

Contrastive reassurance that argues with an imagined objection.

- ❌ "This is documenting a real conflict, not technical debt."
- ✅ "`plugin-a 2.1` needs `core <3`; the project pins `core 4`. The check runs
  in a separate environment."
- ❌ "This isn't a workaround so much as the intended path."
- ✅ State what it does and why. Let the reader judge.
- ❌ Stacked escalation: "Not just X. Not even Y. It's Z." (each step vaguer
  and grander than the last)
- ✅ One sentence naming what it is.

### 3. "Honestly" / "to be fair" / "the truth is"

Confessional hedges. The doc has no feelings to disclose.

- ❌ "Honestly, the biggest gap here is CI."
- ✅ "No CI exists." (Rank it in the gap table if priority matters.)

### 4. Superlatives and stakes inflation

- ❌ "the single most important gap", "the biggest real gap", "this is the one
  that actually matters"
- ✅ Put items in a ranked table. Rank is the priority signal; prose
  restatement is noise.

### 5. Restating the obvious / self-summary / conclusion sections

- ❌ "In summary, as we can see from the above…"
- ❌ "This section covers the verification step." (as the first line of the
  verification section)
- ❌ A `## Conclusion` / "To wrap up…" / "In conclusion…" section that restates
  the doc.
- ✅ Just write the content. Headings already say what the section is. End on
  the last substantive point; no wrap-up section.

### 6. Hedging stacks

`arguably`, `essentially`, `basically`, `effectively`, `in some sense`, `more
or less`, `sort of`, `kind of`, `it could be argued`.

- ❌ "This is arguably essentially a complete fix."
- ✅ "This fixes batch-1 all-ones masks. It does not handle batched input."
  (State the scope precisely instead of hedging.)

### 7. Filler intensifiers

`very`, `really`, `quite`, `extremely`, `incredibly`, `simply`, `just` (when
minimizing), `actually`, `definitely`, `clearly`, `obviously`.

- ❌ "This is actually quite simple to fix."
- ✅ "Fix: add `--checkpoint` to the arg parser."

### 8. Marketing verbs and abstraction nouns

Verbs: `leverage`, `utilize`, `enable`, `empower`, `facilitate`, `streamline`,
`unlock`, `harness`, `revolutionize`, `transform` (when vague), `ensure` (when
vague). Nouns: `solution`, `capability`, `journey`, `experience`, `ecosystem`,
`synergy`, `paradigm`, `paradigm shift`, `game-changer`, `best-in-class`.

- ❌ "The indexer leverages a cache to enable fast search capabilities."
- ✅ "The indexer caches parsed headers; a warm run skips parsing them."

### 9. The rule-of-three / parallel triplets

LLMs pad with three-item lists where one item carries the meaning.

- ❌ "fast, reliable, and production-ready"
- ✅ Name the actual property: "runs in <2s on CPU." Drop the rest unless each
  item is a distinct, verifiable claim.

### 10. Vague quantifiers

`several`, `various`, `a number of`, `many`, `some`, `a variety of`, `numerous`.

- ❌ "There are several gaps in verification."
- ✅ "Three gaps: G2, G6, G9." Use the count and the IDs.

### 11. Transition scaffolding

`That said,`, `With that in mind,`, `It's important to understand that,`,
`At the end of the day,`, `When it comes to`, `In terms of`, `Moving forward,`.

- ❌ "That said, when it comes to packaging, it's important to understand that…"
- ✅ "Packaging: …"

### 12. Em-dash dramatic reveals and rhetorical setups

- ❌ "There's one thing the doc gets wrong — and it's a big one."
- ✅ State it: "The doc assumes a passing smoke test certifies production. It
  does not."

### 13. Rhetorical questions as setups

A question that opens a section only to be answered in the next line.

- ❌ "So what does this mean? Why does it matter?"
- ✅ Delete the question; state the answer.

### 14. Time-relative words (doc-rot)

`currently`, `recently`, `now`, `today`, `nowadays`, `modern`,
`state-of-the-art`, `cutting-edge`, `as of this writing`. They go stale and
force maintenance.

- ❌ "The library currently supports modern GPUs."
- ✅ Pin a version or date, or drop the word: "As of v2.3 (2026-01), supports
  CUDA 12+."

### 15. Decorative emoji

✅ 🚀 ✨ 🎉 🔥 on headings and bullets.

- ❌ "## 🚀 Getting started"
- ✅ "## Getting started"

A functional legend or status column (✅/❌ as pass/fail, as in this doc's
examples) is data, not decoration — that's fine.

### 16. "Note that" / directive padding

`note that`, `keep in mind`, `remember that`, `be aware that`, `bear in mind`,
`it's important to remember`. The sentence almost always stands without the
preamble.

- ❌ "Note that the cache must be cleared first."
- ✅ "Clear the cache first."

### 17. AI-tell vocabulary

`delve`, `tapestry`, `realm`, `landscape` ("the X landscape"), `navigate`
("navigating the"), `testament to`, `plays a crucial/vital role`, `a wide range
of`, `rich set of`, `wealth of`, `treasure trove`, `ever-evolving`,
`fast-paced`, `intricate`, `vibrant`.

- ❌ "This plays a crucial role in navigating the deployment landscape."
- ✅ "This sets the deploy target."

### 18. Wordy connectives and doublets

`in order to`→`to`, `due to the fact that`→`because`, `in the event that`→`if`,
`for the purpose of`→`to`, `each and every`→`each`, `various different`→
`different`, `end result`→`result`, `completely eliminate`→`eliminate`.

- ❌ "In order to completely eliminate each and every error…"
- ✅ "To eliminate every error…"

### 19. Engagement / CTA bait

`let's dive in`, `let's get started`, `buckle up`, `whether you're a beginner
or an expert`, `happy coding`, `feel free to`, `give it a try`.

- ❌ "Whether you're new or experienced, let's dive in!"
- ✅ Delete it. Start with the first instruction.

### 20. Weasel attribution

`studies show`, `experts agree`, `it's widely known`, `best practices say`,
`many believe`, `it's generally accepted` — with no citation.

- ❌ "Studies show this is the fastest approach."
- ✅ Cite it or cut it: "Benchmark (bench/run.py, 2026-01): 1.8s vs 4.2s."
  Unsourced claims should be traceable or removed.

### 21. Staccato fragment cadence

Sentence fragments deployed for dramatic rhythm, not content. The "one punchy
sentence, or three short ones" beat that usually trails an em-dash hook.

- ❌ "We rewrote the parser. From scratch. In a weekend."
- ✅ "We rewrote the parser from scratch over a weekend."

### 22. Bolded pseudo-insight

Phrases bolded for visual rhythm rather than to mark a defined term, label, or
key. Bold cosplaying as structure.

- ❌ "The real win here is **thinking differently about state**."
- ✅ Bold only defined terms, labels, or keys (as this doc bolds **While
  writing** / **As a deslop pass**). Otherwise, unbold it.

### 23. Hedge-and-elevate

Conceding a cartoon objection so the pivot lands harder. Cousin of pattern 2.

- ❌ "While benchmarks have their place, the real story is developer joy."
- ✅ State both as facts: "Benchmark: 1.8s. Separately, the API is smaller —
  see §3." Don't stage a strawman to knock down.

### 24. Obsolete surface narration

Current-state instructions, skills, prompts, README/help text, and assistant
prose describe the active implemented surface. Names of removed, rejected,
superseded, unavailable, or hypothetical components make models and users
search for things they cannot use.

- ❌ "The old Foo extension was removed; use Bar now."
- ✅ "Use Bar for background jobs."
- ✅ A versioned migration may say: "Jouzu v0.1.4 replaces Foo from v0.1.3
  with Bar." The affected versions make the history actionable.
- ✅ Explicit planning/porting inventories and historical research may list
  candidates or prior components when that inventory is the document's task.

## Deslop pass checklist

Run top to bottom over a doc:

1. Delete any sentence that contains no fact, number, path, command, decision,
   or action.
2. Delete intro/meta paragraphs that describe what the doc is or how it was
   produced, unless the reader needs that to act.
3. Search-and-kill the word lists in patterns 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17,
   18. Most can be deleted outright with no rewrite.
4. Replace every "not X but Y" (pattern 2) with a plain statement of Y.
5. Replace vague quantifiers (pattern 10) with counts/IDs.
6. Collapse rule-of-three triplets (pattern 9) to the one claim that matters.
7. Convert prose that ranks/grades importance into a table or a label.
8. Delete rhetorical-question setups (pattern 13) and CTA/engagement bait
   (pattern 19).
9. Replace time-relative words (pattern 14) with a version or date, or delete.
10. Cite or cut weasel attributions (pattern 20).
11. Strip decorative emoji (pattern 15); keep functional legends/status
    columns.
12. Delete any conclusion/wrap-up section (pattern 5).
13. Collapse staccato fragments (pattern 21) into complete sentences.
14. Unbold pseudo-insight (pattern 22); keep bold on defined terms and labels.
15. Rewrite hedge-and-elevate concessions (pattern 23) as parallel facts.
16. Re-read each section's first line; delete it if it just restates the
    heading.
17. Check headings are noun phrases or imperatives, not sentences.
18. Remove obsolete-surface narration (pattern 24) unless the document is an
    explicit planning/porting inventory, historical record, or versioned
    migration/release artifact.
19. Check replacements against the original. If the original was clear,
    grammatically sound, and conveyed the same meaning in fewer words, keep it.
    Retain edits that fix ambiguity, errors, or missing requirements; brevity
    must not remove facts, qualifiers, or necessary context.

## What to keep

Deslop removes filler, not substance. Keep:

- Numbers, file paths, symbol names, commands, config keys, version pins.
- Status markers, priority labels, dependency notes.
- Versioned changelog, release-note, and migration facts that tell users what
  changed between named releases and what action to take.
- Short rationale that changes what the reader does ("X depends on Y, so do Y
  first"). Cut rationale that only justifies a choice to an imagined critic.
- One-line context where a fact is genuinely ambiguous without it.

Blunt phrasing is acceptable; don't smooth terse prose into marketing copy.
